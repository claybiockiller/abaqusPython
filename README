Welcome to an open repository of abaqusPython scripts and macros!

The main purpose of this repository is to collect useful techniques and other gems that are 
useful for abaqus power-users. We also hope that enough sourcecode and examples will 
inspire users to create better scripts. 

Installation
------------

Copy the scripts locally. 


Usage
-----

All the scripts will have a detailed description in the header. 

For the lazy: 
1. Copy the desired script in the current work directory
2. Write "execfile('mydesiredscript.py') in CLI or 'abaqus python mydesiredscript.py' in cmd.
